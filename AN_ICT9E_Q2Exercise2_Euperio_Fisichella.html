		Midnight<br>
		You come and pick me up, no headlights<br>
		Long drive<br>
		Could end in burning flames or paradise<br>
		Fade into view, oh<br>
		It's been a while since I have even heard from you (heard from you)<br>
		And I should just tell you to leave 'cause I<br>
		Know exactly where it leads, but I<br>
		Watch us go 'round and 'round each time<br>

		You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye<br>
		And I got that red lip classic thing that you like<br>
		And when we go crashing down, we come back every time<br>
		'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style<br>
		You got that long hair, slicked back, white T-shirt<br>
		And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt<br>
		And when we go crashing down, we come back every time<br>
		'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style<br>

		So it goes<br>
		He can't keep his wild eyes on the road, mm<br>
		Takes me home<br>
		The lights are off, he's taking off his coat, mm, yeah<br>
		I say, "I heard, oh<br>
		That you've been out and about with some other girl, some other girl"<br>
		He says, "What you heard is true, but I<br>
		Can't stop thinkin' 'bout you and I"<br>
		I said, "I've been there too a few times"<br>
